# 42_piscine
42 SÃ£o Paulo works with project-based learning. Programming is like any other job: you just learn by doing. Instead of learning theories that might not apply in real life, you have increasingly difficult programming challenges to solve individually or in teams.

The piscina is our selection process, but it is also a 100% face-to-face immersive training of 26 consecutive days. In this immersion, everyone who participates will live in practice the learning method and culture of the 42.
